 * Simulates uploading a file to a custom S3 storage server.
 * In a real-world application, this function would:
 * 1. Make a request to your own backend server to get a secure, presigned S3 URL.
 * 2. Use the presigned URL to upload the file directly to S3 from the client.
 * This approach avoids exposing S3 credentials on the frontend.
 * 
 * For this project, we'll simulate the upload by returning a local blob URL.
 * 
 * @param file The file to be "uploaded".
 * @returns A promise that resolves to the public URL of the file.
